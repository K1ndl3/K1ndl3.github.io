### CPSC120A

Through out the 12 labs that we had, the following 3 are my favorite:

1. **Lab 03**

Being the very first "hard" lab that I got to do, This lab tested my problem solving skills by making me disect problems into smaller components to solve individually. This lab also taught me to first understand and know how to solve a problem first before coding. Given the nature of the lab and the multiple intersecting functions, I needed to understand the why and how behind each function. As opposed to the labs before, lab 03 had minimal #TODO that guided me throughout the program. As a result, it forced me to plan out my code meticulously and to have a purpose for each variables and lines of code. Overall, Lab 03 was a very fun project that gave me important insights to how to effectively build a large program.

2. **Lab 07**

Deceptively easy at first, part 2 of Lab 07 taught me the importance of robustness of a program. Beyond user-input validation, the overall logic of the function must make sense to the user and work as the programmer intended. I was taught this lesson as I struggled to properly reflect the street sign of Date street. This exercise taught me to be ware of my cognitive biases, in particular, my confirmation bias. Overall, this lab was extremely fun as it helped me practice logic statements in the overall flow of the program.

3. **Lab 09**

As my first formal algorithm, I learned about linear search through Lab 09 part 1. When looking through an unordered map, it is imperative to find the maximun and minimum of a 
array/list. As a result, this lab taught to use loops effectively and in a clever manner to efficiently comb through the many elements of a list. Overall, this lab was very enjoyable and it taught me how to think algorithmically.
