### CPSC120A

Through out the 12 labs that we had, the following 3 are my favorite:

1. **Lab 03**

Being the very first "hard" lab that I got to do, This lab tested my problem solving skills by making me disect problems into smaller components to solve individually. This lab also taught me to first understand and know how to solve a problem first before coding. Given the nature of the lab and the multiple intersecting functions, I needed to understand the why and how behind each function. As opposed to the labs before, lab 03 had minimal #TODO that guided me throughout the program. As a result, it forced me to plan out my code meticulously and to have a purpose for each variables and lines of code.
